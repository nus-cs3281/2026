### AI-Assisted Coding Tools

So far, I've experimented with many AI coding tools, incorporating them into my workflow and trying them out.

I've tried [opencode](https://opencode.ai/), [Mistral Vibe](https://mistral.ai/products/vibe), [Proxy AI](https://docs.tryproxy.io/), Github Copilot, [Cline](https://cline.bot/). 

They can be divided into roughly two categories; AI tools that live in the CLI and those that integrate directly into IDEs. While their usage may be similar (many of them can inject context using slash/@ commands, in addition to other common features), their value can be quite different.

I've found that tools that integrated directly into IDEs were superior for engineering, provided that one does not enable settings such as "YOLO" mode (editing without permission). This way, you may review the AI's work file-by-file, and guiding it if its approach needs changing.

On top of that, leveraging [plan/act modes](https://docs.cline.bot/features/plan-and-act), [skills](https://docs.cline.bot/features/skills), and keeping context focused can improve model performance.

### Langchain

I learnt and used [Langchain](https://docs.langchain.com/) to create an AI workflow for the CSV classifier task.
