### Github Copilot
Learning points:
- Provide as much context as possible, using extensions (@), commands (/), and file context (#)
- Keep each chat focused on a relatively small objective
- Agent mode is powerful for complex tasks, and also good as an investigative tool compared to ask mode with findings given as a rich document
- Treat is as a pair programmer, explain and ask things as you would to a human partner
- It is easy to get lost changing codes since Copilot makes it much easier to debug and try things out quickly that it is worth the time to ask yourself if any changes should be part of another PR

Resources used:
- Github website
- Gemini and ChatGPT for additional help
