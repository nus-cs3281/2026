### GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant built by GitHub and OpenAI that helps programmers write code faster and with less effort.

Learning points:
- Give examples of existing code with similar functionality, to avoid hallucination and ensure the code quality is consistent across the codebase
- Properly describe the expected usage of the product which is not always obvious when implementing libraries and dependencies. This can affect the implementation method chosen.
- Ask for many possible solutions (ie. planning) and evaluate them yourself before deciding on one and guiding the AI tool to implement it.
